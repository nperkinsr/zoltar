# Zoltar
**Zoltar** is a browser-based fortune-telling card that delivers weird and funny prophecies with a dramatic flip. Inspired by the classic Zoltar fortune machines, this project was created to practise using JSON data, random selection, and CSS card-flipping animations.

When you click the “Reveal” button, the Zoltar card flips to show a mystical prediction made up of five randomised elements, each drawn from a different array stored in a JSON file:

+ **Fortune** – The main prediction
+ **Only applies if** – A random, often ridiculous condition
+ **Avoid today** – Something suspicious to steer clear of
+ **Lucky item** – Your lucky object for the day
+ **Heed the wisdom of Zoltar** – An oddly specific or unhinged piece of advice

Each array contains around 30 unique entries, ensuring that every flip feels fresh, weird, and slightly cursed.

+ This project was built to practise:
+ Fetching and working with JSON data
+ Selecting random items from arrays
+ Creating interactive UI with CSS transitions
+ Enhancing user experience with humour and surprise
